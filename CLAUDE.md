# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

- Build: `./gradlew clean assemble`
- Run all tests: `./gradlew test`
- Run a single test class: `./gradlew test --tests "com.hulk.processor.ApplicationTests"`
- Run the app locally: `./gradlew bootRun` (requires Postgres up via `docker-compose up -d postgres`; Elasticsearch and Kafka are referenced in `application.yaml` but not yet provisioned — see TODOs below)
- CI mirrors `build.gradle.kts` via `.github/workflows/gradle.yml` (JDK 21, `./gradlew clean assemble` on push/PR to `master`)

## Architecture

This is a Spring Batch application (Java 21, Spring Boot 3.5) that consumes GitHub repository events from Kafka, persists metrics to Elasticsearch, and runs ML-based predictions on repositories. It is one service in a larger pipeline — a separate loader service presumably publishes `Repository` records onto the Kafka topic this app reads from.

### Two batch jobs, driven by one topic

`BatchConfiguration` wires two independent Spring Batch jobs, both reading from the same Kafka topic (`app.kafka.consumer.topic`) but with different consumer group IDs (`KafkaConfiguration`), so each job gets its own copy of every message:

- **`repositoryMetricsJob`** (`repositoryStep`, chunk size 100): reads `Repository` from Kafka via `repositoryKafkaReader` (consumer group `repository-step-group`) and fans each chunk out to a `CompositeItemWriter` whose delegates are every `ItemWriter<? super Repository>` bean in the context — currently the writers under `repository/{collaborators,commits,language,supportduration}`, each pairing an Elasticsearch repository with a writer that extends `AbstractItemWriter`.
- **`repositoryMlJob`** (`mlStep`, chunk size 25): reads the same topic via `repositoryMlReader` (consumer group `ml-step-group`), runs each `Repository` through `MlRepositoryProcessor` (an `ItemProcessor` that calls `MlModel.predict` on a virtual-thread executor and returns a `CompletableFuture<MlMetrics>`), then writes with an `ItemWriter<CompletableFuture<MlMetrics>>` built from `ml/popularity` and `ml/purpose` writers, which extend `AbstractCompletableFutureItemWriter` to await all futures in the chunk (`CompletableFutureCollector.allOf()`) before writing the resolved values to Elasticsearch.

Both steps use `.readerIsTransactionalQueue()` and `.faultTolerant()` since the reader is a Kafka queue, not a resumable datastore.

### Job triggering: scheduled + on-demand

`RepositoryScheduler` fires both jobs on cron schedules (`repositoryMetricsJob` every 30 min, `repositoryMlJob` hourly), each on its own dedicated virtual-thread `ExecutorService` bean (`repositorySchedulerExecutor` / `repositoryMlSchedulerExecutor`) via `@Async`. `RepositoryJobController` (`/api/repositories/jobs`) exposes the same capability over HTTP (start a job by name, list running executions, list job names), backed by `RepositoryJobManager`, which resolves job names to `Job` beans (`afterPropertiesSet`) and delegates to Spring Batch's `JobLauncher`/`JobExplorer`. Any new `Job` bean is automatically picked up here — no registration step beyond defining the bean.

### Writer pattern

New Elasticsearch sinks follow a fixed shape: an `ElasticsearchRepository<Document, UUID>` + an `ItemWriter` that extends either `AbstractItemWriter` (plain `Repository` input, like the metrics writers) or `AbstractCompletableFutureItemWriter` (futures-based input, like the ML writers), passing a `Function<V, D>` mapper and the Elasticsearch repository into the inherited `write(...)`. Document model classes live in `model/`.

### ML model lifecycle

`MlModel` wraps a TensorFlow 1.15 (`org.tensorflow:tensorflow`) graph. `GithubModel` (bound in `MlConfiguration`) loads a model named `"model"` and uses `RepositoryFeatureConvertor` to turn a `Repository` into model input features; `MlRepositoryProcessor` owns the model's lifecycle and must `close()` it (and its own executor) on shutdown, since `AutoCloseable` isn't wired to anything automatically — check how/where this processor gets closed before assuming it happens for free.

### Persistence

- **Postgres**: used only as the Spring Batch job repository (`spring.batch.jdbc.initialize-schema: never` — schema is managed by Liquibase, `changelog/db.changelog-master.yaml`), not for domain data.
- **Elasticsearch**: the actual data store for all domain documents (commits, collaborators, languages, support duration, ML outputs). `ElasticSearchConfiguration` builds the client from the first URI in `spring.elasticsearch.uris` plus basic auth.

### Known gaps (don't assume these are wired up)

- `application.yaml` has `elasticsearch.uris` and `kafka.bootstrap-servers` marked `//todo` — only Postgres is actually provisioned in `docker-compose.yaml` (the `app` service itself is commented out).
